# Babylon Lite Stealth Grid

Babylon Lite Stealth Grid is a portrait-oriented Babylon Lite sprite game
prototype that runs with WebGPU.

A Babylon-branded startup preloader appears before the first game graphics,
covers asset loading, and closes after the first rendered frame. Loading errors
show a Retry button. This lightweight screen is local to the project because
Babylon Lite does not ship the full engine's default loading UI.

## Live Demo

[Play the live demo](https://samuelasherrivello.github.io/babylon-lite-stealth-grid/)

Current release: **v0.1.8**. Open the link without query parameters: the preloader
finishes, then the Start menu appears. No extra build arguments are needed;
GitHub Actions runs plain `npm run build`.

WebGPU not working? See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Getting Started

### Play Project

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open the repository root in a command line.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm run build` to build the project.
5. Run `npm run dev` to launch the local development server.
6. Open the URL printed by Vite.

### Release Workflow

1. Run `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run test:publish`, and `npm run build`.
   Both the full test suite and focused publishing checks must pass before deployment.
2. Commit and push to `master` in
   [`SamuelAsherRivello/babylon-lite-stealth-grid`](https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/babylon-lite-stealth-grid).
   The `Deploy live demo` workflow runs all tests, validates publishing contracts, builds `dist`,
   and deploys it using GitHub Actions. No release tag is needed to publish.
3. Wait for the [deployment workflow](https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/babylon-lite-stealth-grid/actions/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)
   to succeed, then verify the [live game](https://samuelasherrivello.github.io/babylon-lite-stealth-grid/).

For a versioned release, also update `public/environment.json` and optionally
create a matching three-component GitHub Release tag such as `v0.1.8`.
The displayed version comes from that file, not from Git tags.

GitHub repository Settings → Pages → Source must remain **GitHub Actions**.
To redeploy the current branch without a new commit, use **Run workflow** on
`Deploy live demo`. Vite uses `base: "./"`, so asset URLs remain relative to the
Pages project path after a repository rename. If renamed again, update the Git
remote and these README links; keep the workflow branch aligned with the
repository's publishing branch. The screenshot above also opens the live game.

To recover from a bad publish, make a corrective commit and push it to `master`;
do not rewrite history or force-push.

## Project Overview

This repo demonstrates browser-based game development with Babylon.js Lite,
JavaScript, Vite, and WebGPU.

### Documentation

- `README.md`: Primary documentation for this repo.
- [`documentation/tile-map.md`](documentation/tile-map.md): Tiled map editing
  workflow.
- [`documentation/grid-and-ui-contract.md`](documentation/grid-and-ui-contract.md): Logical grid
  and UI placement contract.
- [`documentation/render-depth-order.md`](documentation/render-depth-order.md): Babylon Lite
  sprite and DOM overlay depth bands.

### Configuration

- `Game Engine`: Babylon.js Lite powers the graphics and gameplay systems.
- `Renderer`: WebGPU renders the game in supported browsers.
- `Level Editor`: Tiled authors the terrain map and layers.

### Structure

- `index.html`: Browser page and application entry point.
- `src/main.js`: Babylon Lite game bootstrap and scene composition.
- `src/ui/style.css`: Application styles and responsive layout.
- `src`: Application source code.
- `test`: Automated tests.

### Dependencies

- `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
- `vite.config.js`: Configures local development and production builds.

## Project Details

### Editor Tooling

- Visual Studio Code: Source code editor.
- Tiled: Tile map and level editor.
- Babylon.js Inspector: Runtime scene inspection.

### Code Packages

- `@babylonjs/lite`: Lightweight Babylon.js rendering and game APIs.
- `vite`: JavaScript bundling and local development server.
- Node.js test runner: Automated JavaScript testing.

### Tile Map

Levels are authored with Tiled. The AI prepares the Tiled project, map,
tilesets, grid, origin marker, layers, properties, and runtime integration; the
human edits content only on the existing layers.

See [Tile Map Editing](documentation/tile-map.md) for the open, edit, save,
close, and play workflow.

### OpenSpec

[OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev/) keeps feature intent, implementation, and
current specifications aligned.

| # | Name | Command | Custom | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | :---: | --- |
| 1 | [Explore](.agents/skills/openspec-explore/SKILL.md) | `/opsx:explore` | ☐ | Optional feature discovery and planning. |
| 2 | [Propose](.agents/skills/openspec-propose/SKILL.md) | `/opsx:propose <name>` | ☐ | Creates one focused feature change. |
| 3 | [Grill Me](.agents/skills/open-spec-grill-me/SKILL.md) | `/open-spec-grill-me <name>` | ☑ | Resolves design decisions before implementation. |
| 4 | [Apply](.agents/skills/openspec-apply-change/SKILL.md) | `/opsx:apply <name>` | ☐ | Implements and completes one change. |
| 5 | [Sync](.agents/skills/openspec-sync-specs/SKILL.md) | `/opsx:sync <name>` | ☐ | Updates main specs without archiving. |
| 6 | [Archive](.agents/skills/openspec-archive-change/SKILL.md) | `/opsx:archive <name>` | ☐ | Finalizes and archives a change. |

#### Workflow Depth

- LOW: Use no steps. Just chat with a fast model like
  [Spark](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.3-codex).
- MED: Use steps 2/4 with a
  [Luna](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.6-luna) or
  [Terra](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.6-terra).
- HIGH: Use steps 1-6 with
  [Sol](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.6-sol).

## Troubleshooting

### WebGPU not working?

First, open the [official WebGPU Samples hello-triangle
test](https://webgpu.github.io/webgpu-samples/?sample=helloTriangle). If it does
not render, the browser or device cannot currently run this project's WebGPU
path.

For Chrome-specific troubleshooting, see the official [WebGPU
documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/webgpu/). It
covers browser requirements, secure origins, graphics acceleration,
`chrome://gpu`, and the `enable-unsafe-webgpu` development flag.

Third-party references:

- [WebGPU Report](https://webgpureport.org/) shows the detected adapter, limits,
  and features.
- [WebGPU Fundamentals](https://webgpufundamentals.org/) explains compatibility
  mode and its experimental Chrome flag.
- [WebGPU Check](https://webgpucheck.com/) provides browser-specific enablement
  guidance and diagnostics.
- [Can I use: WebGPU](https://caniuse.com/webgpu) tracks current browser support.

## BIS Account smoke preview

Settings → **⚡ Account** opens the complete public BIS Account UI. Back returns to Settings; ordinary guest play requires no account. Account loads on demand, and a failed load keeps a Back path. The game owns restart after BIS confirms logout. The package is a hash-named snapshot in `vendor/`, with locked React peers; no sibling source import is used.

See the [BIS smoke runbook](../blockchain-integration-service/documentation/SMOKE_TEST_BIS_TO_GAME.md) for build/refresh provenance, isolated tests, separate origins and private disposable-account acceptance. Planning is coordinated by BIS's `smoke-test-bis-to-game` change.

Game server: `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5175 --strictPort`. Windows browser: http://127.0.0.1:15175/. Paste this entire line in PowerShell and leave the terminal open:

```powershell
ssh -N -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 127.0.0.1:15175:127.0.0.1:5175 contabo-srive
```

The BIS demo at http://127.0.0.1:15174/ has separate origin storage. Keep the hostname/port stable; do not copy wallet storage or record recovery words.
