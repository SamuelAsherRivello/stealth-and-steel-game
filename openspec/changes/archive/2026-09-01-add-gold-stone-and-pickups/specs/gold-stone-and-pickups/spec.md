## Purpose

Provides a Tiled-authored destructible Gold Stone that creates animated, player-only Gold Pickup objects as a visible resource reward.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: One-shot Gold Stone placement
Each authored Gold Stone placement SHALL spawn exactly one stone at its authored position per level load and SHALL NOT respawn during that level session.

#### Scenario: Level loads a Gold Stone
- **WHEN** a level containing a Gold Stone placement is loaded
- **THEN** exactly one stone appears at that placement

### Requirement: Gold Stone appearance and idle animation
Each spawned stone SHALL independently choose Gold Stone 5 or Gold Stone 6, display its idle frame, and play its six-frame highlight animation once after a randomized delay between five and ten seconds, repeating while alive.

#### Scenario: Stone idles and highlights
- **WHEN** a living stone reaches its randomized highlight delay
- **THEN** it plays one complete highlight cycle and returns to its idle frame

### Requirement: Projectile damage and object death
The stone SHALL expose a combat collider for the existing player projectile attack and SHALL have exactly one health. At zero health, it SHALL stop accepting damage and perform ObjectDeath by fading, rotating, and shrinking, then be removed.

#### Scenario: Player projectile destroys stone
- **WHEN** an existing player projectile overlaps a living Gold Stone combat collider
- **THEN** the stone takes one damage and begins ObjectDeath

### Requirement: Gold Stone drop creation
After ObjectDeath completes, the stone SHALL create two or three Gold Pickup objects with equal probability. Each pickup SHALL independently choose Gold Stone 1 or Gold Stone 2.

#### Scenario: Stone creates pickups after death
- **WHEN** the stone finishes ObjectDeath
- **THEN** two or three independently rendered pickups are created

### Requirement: 9-grid pickup placement
Each pickup SHALL choose a distinct valid unoccupied tile from the eight cells surrounding the stone's center cell in the 3-by-3 9-grid. Invalid or blocked destinations SHALL be re-rolled; if fewer valid cells remain, only safely placeable pickups SHALL be created.

#### Scenario: Pickups land around the stone
- **WHEN** pickups are created
- **THEN** every pickup targets a distinct valid neighboring 9-grid cell and never the center cell

### Requirement: Pickup spawn animation and collection
Each pickup SHALL use a tweened PickupSpawnAnimation from the stone position toward its destination, including fade-in, scale-in, and an arc rising about one tile. Its player walk-collider SHALL be active immediately, and overlap by the player SHALL cancel the spawn tween and begin PickupObjectDeath.

#### Scenario: Player collects a flying pickup
- **WHEN** the player's walk collider overlaps a pickup during PickupSpawnAnimation
- **THEN** the spawn tween is cancelled and PickupObjectDeath begins

### Requirement: Pickup object death
PickupObjectDeath SHALL fade and scale the pickup out, then remove it. Pickup collection SHALL have no other gameplay consequence and non-player colliders SHALL NOT collect it.

#### Scenario: Pickup disappears on collection
- **WHEN** the player collects a pickup
- **THEN** it fades and scales out and no reward or other state change occurs
