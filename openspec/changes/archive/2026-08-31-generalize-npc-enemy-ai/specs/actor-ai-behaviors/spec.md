## Purpose

Defines reusable autonomous-actor decision and navigation behavior while allowing each NPC or enemy type to retain its own meaningful animation states and reactions.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Autonomous actors use explicit behavior states
Each autonomous actor SHALL expose an explicit current behavior state. Every behavior state SHALL select the animation associated with that state, and AI decisions or completion events SHALL be the only causes of state transitions.

#### Scenario: Decision changes actor state
- **WHEN** an idle actor's policy chooses a movement behavior
- **THEN** the actor enters its movement state and plays that state's animation

#### Scenario: State remains unchanged
- **WHEN** no decision trigger or completion event applies
- **THEN** the actor retains its current state and animation without restarting it

### Requirement: Shared AI world snapshots are actor-neutral
The AI system SHALL evaluate an actor-neutral world snapshot containing active gameplay time, the controlled actor's position and grid cell, living perceived entities with stable type identifiers, and current walkability blockers. A sheep or enemy policy SHALL consume that snapshot without depending directly on player, rendering, DOM, or main-loop internals.

#### Scenario: Dead target is omitted
- **WHEN** a player, sheep, or enemy is no longer living
- **THEN** AI policies do not perceive that entity as a threat or attack target

#### Scenario: Gameplay is paused
- **WHEN** active gameplay time does not advance
- **THEN** autonomous decision timers, route movement, and state completion do not advance

### Requirement: Random decisions are configurable and deterministic under test
Idle-duration ranges, path-distance ranges, target tie-breaking, and destination tie-breaking SHALL accept an injected random source and SHALL validate configured inclusive bounds.

#### Scenario: Lower random endpoint is selected
- **WHEN** deterministic randomness selects the lower endpoint of a configured range
- **THEN** the actor uses the configured minimum value

#### Scenario: Invalid range is supplied
- **WHEN** a minimum duration or distance is greater than its maximum
- **THEN** actor AI creation fails with a configuration error

### Requirement: Autonomous movement uses shared obstacle-aware navigation
Route-based autonomous movement SHALL use cardinally adjacent grid cells, remain within the logical grid, and exclude any cell that cannot contain the controlled actor's collider without overlapping terrain or a blocking dynamic collider. The route SHALL move smoothly through cell-center waypoints and SHALL stop safely if a remaining segment becomes blocked.

#### Scenario: Direct route is blocked
- **WHEN** a reachable destination requires turning around non-walkable terrain
- **THEN** the route follows safe cardinal cells around the obstruction

#### Scenario: Dynamic blocker invalidates movement
- **WHEN** a dynamic non-permitted collider blocks the actor's next waypoint after planning
- **THEN** the actor stops before overlap and returns control to its policy for a new decision

### Requirement: Sheep preserves stimulus-driven frightened behavior
The sheep SHALL remain idle until a configured frightening living entity enters its inclusive fear distance. The initial sheep SHALL treat both living players and living enemies as frightening. It SHALL enter `bouncing`, remain stationary for the complete bounce animation, enter `running` only when a safe flee route exists, and enter `cooldown` after reaching the route end or failing safely. Its route SHALL increase separation from the triggering threat using the configured flee-distance range.

#### Scenario: No threat is nearby
- **WHEN** no configured frightening living entity is within the sheep's fear distance
- **THEN** the sheep remains idle regardless of elapsed idle time

#### Scenario: Threat enters range
- **WHEN** a configured frightening living entity enters range while the sheep is idle
- **THEN** the sheep plays one complete bounce before following a safe route away from that entity

#### Scenario: Enemy threatens initial sheep
- **WHEN** a living enemy enters the initial sheep's fear distance while the sheep is idle
- **THEN** the sheep begins its frightened response

### Requirement: Sheep has a short post-flee cooldown
Each sheep SHALL have a configurable post-flee cooldown during which it remains stationary and ignores frightening entities. The initial sheep SHALL use a one-second cooldown. When the cooldown elapses, the sheep SHALL return to `idle` and resume threat evaluation, allowing nearby attackers a short opportunity to catch it.

#### Scenario: Threat remains nearby after fleeing
- **WHEN** the sheep finishes or safely abandons a flee route while a frightening entity remains in range
- **THEN** it remains stationary without starting another bounce for one second

#### Scenario: Cooldown completes
- **WHEN** the configured post-flee cooldown elapses during active gameplay
- **THEN** the sheep returns to idle and may react to any currently nearby frightening entity

### Requirement: Enemy alternates between idle and patrol decisions
An enemy with no attackable target in range SHALL remain idle for a randomly selected duration within its configured inclusive idle range, then SHALL choose a reachable patrol destination within its configured inclusive path-distance range and spawn-centered home radius. The initial goblin SHALL use a home radius of four grid cells, equivalent to 256 pixels on the current 64-pixel grid. It SHALL enter `walking` while following the safe route and SHALL return to `idle` to choose a new duration after arriving or failing to obtain or continue a route.

#### Scenario: Idle timer expires
- **WHEN** the enemy's selected idle duration elapses and no attackable target is in range
- **THEN** the enemy chooses a reachable walkable patrol destination and starts walking toward it

#### Scenario: Patrol destination is reached
- **WHEN** the enemy reaches the last waypoint of its patrol route
- **THEN** it stops, enters idle, and selects a new idle duration before making another patrol decision

#### Scenario: No patrol destination is reachable
- **WHEN** no valid destination exists in the configured patrol-distance range
- **THEN** the enemy remains in or returns to idle and waits for another decision interval without entering blocked terrain

#### Scenario: Reachable destination is outside home radius
- **WHEN** a walkable patrol candidate is more than four grid cells from the initial goblin's spawn cell
- **THEN** the candidate is excluded from its patrol destinations

### Requirement: Enemy attacks only eligible nearby targets
The initial goblin SHALL consider living players and sheep attackable. It SHALL start an attack only when an attackable target is within its configured inclusive melee distance; elapsed time or patrol selection alone SHALL NOT start an attack. If multiple targets are in range, it SHALL choose the nearest target, using stable snapshot order to resolve equal distances.

#### Scenario: No target is in melee range
- **WHEN** neither a living player nor a living sheep is within the goblin's melee distance
- **THEN** the goblin does not start a swing attack

#### Scenario: Player enters melee range during patrol
- **WHEN** a living player becomes the nearest attackable target in melee range while the goblin is patrolling
- **THEN** the goblin stops route movement and starts one attack directed toward the player

#### Scenario: Sheep is the nearest target
- **WHEN** a living sheep is nearer than every other attackable entity within melee range
- **THEN** the goblin starts one attack directed toward the sheep

### Requirement: Enemy attacks are atomic and use a short recovery
When an enemy starts an attack, it SHALL lock movement, capture the selected target direction, and play exactly one directional attack animation without retargeting mid-swing. After the animation, it SHALL enter a configurable recovery state that locks movement and rejects attacks. The initial goblin SHALL recover for 0.75 seconds, then reevaluate the current world. A target remaining in range MAY cause another attack decision after recovery; a target that moved or died SHALL NOT be attacked based only on its stale snapshot.

#### Scenario: Target moves during swing
- **WHEN** the selected target changes position while an attack animation is playing
- **THEN** the current swing retains its starting direction and does not restart

#### Scenario: Attack animation completes
- **WHEN** the enemy finishes its one non-looping swing
- **THEN** it enters recovery without moving or starting another attack

#### Scenario: Recovery completes
- **WHEN** the initial goblin has spent 0.75 active seconds recovering after its swing
- **THEN** it reevaluates living nearby targets before choosing another attack, idle, or patrol behavior

### Requirement: Policies can extend without changing the shared controller
The shared AI contract SHALL allow another actor type to define its own state set, perception filters, decision triggers, transition rules, and animation mapping while reusing timing, navigation, and waypoint movement services.

#### Scenario: New autonomous actor is added
- **WHEN** a developer adds an actor whose states differ from both sheep and goblin states
- **THEN** the actor can supply a new policy without adding those states to a universal shared state enum
