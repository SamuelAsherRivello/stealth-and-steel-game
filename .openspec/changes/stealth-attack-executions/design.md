## Context

See proposal.md for motivation. The current runtime already snapshots enemy grid cells and headings, uses `tile-shadow.png` for forward perception, keeps bush gravity inside the player movement loop, and owns health/death state in a shared combat actor. The prototype proves the base rear-cell, pull, and kill path but does not retain shadow sprites for transitions, distinguish execution presentation from the ordinary knife lifecycle, or implement the confirmed execution choreography and immunity.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Retain per-enemy eligibility versions so a turn or movement cancels gameplay use immediately while a prior visual instance can fade out.
- Keep the execution state owned by the player/combat lifecycle rather than by broad AI state or terrain collision.
- Reuse loaded knife art and the existing tile-shadow atlas without dependencies or new assets.

**Non-Goals:**
- Changing perception range, terrain sight blocking, enemy navigation, grid/collider dimensions, player-controlled jumping, or regular knife combat.

## Decisions

### Separate eligibility from presentation

The rear-cell controller will publish immutable eligibility tokens keyed by enemy record identity. A small render-instance registry will retain yellow shadow sprites independently, interpolate opacity over 0.125 active seconds, and remove them only after fade-out. Gameplay queries use only current tokens, never retained visual instances. This avoids a visual grace period after turning or movement.

Alternative: recreate all shadow sprites every frame. Rejected because it cannot represent a fade-out once a zone leaves the current snapshot.

### Reuse gravity mechanics without conflating bush ownership

The player will use a separate rear-cell gravity controller with the same 0.75-grid-distance gate, 0.125-second acceleration, collision cancellation, and 0.25-second hold as bush gravity. Zone selection sorts by stable record order before arming. Bush rearm/overlap state remains independent because a rear cell is not a bush collider.

Alternative: merge zone state into bush gravity. Rejected because bush exit/rearm semantics differ and would couple unrelated terrain behavior to enemy state.

### Add an explicit execution player state

An armed Attack will atomically validate its token, select the target, consume the rear-cell arm, start player execution state, and start target execution death. The player center and grid spot stay fixed while rendering applies a temporary lunge offset based on the target vector. Execution state controls its 0.8-second lock, input handling, visual reset, and damage-immunity query; it must clear on pause-compatible teardown, player death, level reset, and completion.

Alternative: treat execution as a normal knife swing with a special attack-start callback. Rejected because that permits the normal 200ms midpoint, does not model lock/immunity, and cannot own the visual lunge lifecycle safely.

### Parameterize special combat death

Combat death will accept an execution profile so its target remains non-interactive from the immediate zero-health transition through the 0.8-second stronger-knockback, shrink/fade, and three-spin animation. Standard lethal damage keeps its existing 250ms behavior.

Alternative: add a parallel enemy-removal path. Rejected because it would bypass shared health events, collider removal, and death completion ownership.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [A yellow cell under terrain looks actionable] → Keep it as the requested directional signal; physical collision makes unreachable cells inert.
- [Multiple yellow cells share one position] → Sort by stable record order before arming and test repeatability.
- [Invulnerability can mask incoming projectile cleanup] → Continue consuming/dismissing valid incoming hit projectiles even when their damage is ignored.
- [Visual transforms can conflict with spawn, damage, or death transforms] → Give execution lunge an explicit lifecycle and clear it before ordinary presentation resumes; target death supersedes other target transforms.
- [Concurrent normal and execution attacks] → Atomically consume the armed zone before starting execution and reject Attack while either lifecycle is active.
- [C072 dagger-combo work changes the ordinary Attack lifecycle] → Keep C073 execution as a distinct armed branch and integrate it with the composed lifecycle rather than restoring a fixed knife-swing assumption.

## Migration Plan

1. Add focused controller, renderer, player-state, combat-state, and game-loop tests before changing runtime behavior.
2. Implement eligibility and fading presentation, then rear-cell gravity and deterministic selection.
3. Implement execution state, special death profile, immunity, and visual-only lunge.
4. Run focused and full tests, production build, and a browser scenario covering activation, cancellation, overlap selection, immunity, and recovery.
5. Roll back by removing the C073 runtime wiring; no persisted data or migration is required.
